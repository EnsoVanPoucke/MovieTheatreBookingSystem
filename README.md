# TheatreBookingSystem
A theatre ticket booking system created with Laravel.

> 📘 Note: This project was developed as part of an academic challenge, where I learned Laravel and built a project to apply my initial understanding of the framework.

## Motivation
I chose to create a ticket booking system similar to the one used by cinemas like Kinepolis. I found the seat selection page particularly fascinating, as it required a combination of dynamic UI and backend logic to handle seat availability and reservations.
Through this project, I’ve gained valuable insight into how such systems work, and I’m excited to continue refining this application with more features.
